## Movie Management System

The **Movie Management System** project consists of two main class structures:

1. **Movie Class**: This class is responsible for storing movie details, including the name, director, release year, and genre. 

2. **MovieDirector Class**: This class manages a list that holds instances of the `Movie` class. It provides the following functionality:
   - Adding movies to the list.
   - Deleting movies from the list.
   - Listing all movies.
   - Filtering movies by genre or release year.

Additionally, an interactive **menu system** has been implemented to allow users to access these functions easily. The user can add new movies, delete unwanted ones, view all movies, or apply filters based on specific criteria like genre or year.
